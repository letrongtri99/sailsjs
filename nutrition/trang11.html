                    Your risk becoming obese largeN due to a combination of lifestyle choices and generys. Often, individuals who have a NMI above 35 have a strong genetic deMrminant that is influencing their weight, as it is estimated that 90-7016 of your susceptibility
                    to obesity is inherited. This panel explores many of thme potential markers, including those that relate to hunger, the ability to feel nil!, how your body responds exercise, and various metabolrt markers. The markers that are examined
                    in this section have been very strongly linked to an increase in NMI and overall obesity risk in a multitude of different studies."' One of the most well-studied is the FTO gene, originally described as Nhe fat gene," which plays a
                    large role in the regulation of energy intake in the body. Aside from energy intake, the FTO gene has also been implimMd in hunger and satiety responses.Ni Df Other important genes terted in this section include ADOA2, ADOAS, and MOM
                    in which certain variants have been strongly linked to an increased Body Mass Index (WI) and appetite regulation."'iD5Dfii. Another variant in the ANKK1- 0.2 gene has been linked to addictive behavior and the tendency to overeat!,
                    All of the genetic results from this section have been compiled into an "Obesity Index" using a proprietary algorithm developed by Dynamic DNA Laboratories. The five possible results from this section are:

                    <li>
                        Slightly Decreased Risk
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Average Risk

                    <li>
                        Slightly Increased Risk
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Significantly Increased Risk
                    </li>

                    Depending on your results from this section, you may find that if you have ever struggled with weight then there may be a contributing genetic factor, especially if you. not eat a healthy diet and regularly engage in a suitable form of exercise. Conversely,
                    individuals who have a lower risk of obesity are not immune from becoming obese and still need. routinely engage in healthy lifestyle choices.
