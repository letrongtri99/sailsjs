                Zinc is the second most abundant trace metal after iron and is critical for growth and development in pregna ncy and childhood. Zinc is involved in a wide range. biological processes including immune function, protein synthesis, wound healing, DNA synthis,
                and cell division, and kis required for the senses of taste and mll. Unlike other micronutrient, the body has no way of storing zinc so it is important to get adequate a mount of zinc through one's dietary intake.
